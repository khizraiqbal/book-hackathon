# Prompt
```
home page is physically not seeing on website
```

# Response
Created specification for home page visibility issue. The spec includes user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria to address the issue where the home page is not visible on the website. Created the spec file at specs/1-home-page-visibility/spec.md and a quality checklist at specs/1-home-page-visibility/checklists/requirements.md.

# Outcome
Specification created successfully with all required sections. The spec addresses the issue of the home page not being visible on the website by defining user scenarios, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria. The specification is ready for the next phase (clarification or planning).

# Evaluation
The specification follows the required template structure and includes all mandatory sections. Requirements are testable and success criteria are measurable. All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved with reasonable assumptions.
